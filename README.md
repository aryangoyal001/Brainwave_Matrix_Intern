## Task 1 -ðŸ“° Fake News Detection Model
- This is my **Fake News Detection Task** for the **Machine Learning / Python Projects** series.
  -  This Fake News Detector is a Python-based ML project that allows users to detect whether a news headline or article is **REAL** or **FAKE** using text classification techniques.

---

## Project Description

- I created a **Fake News Detection Model** using my **Python and Machine Learning skills**.
- Fake news can mislead public opinion and create confusion â€” detecting it is a crucial real-world use case of machine learning.
- This application uses TF-IDF for text feature extraction and PassiveAggressiveClassifier for classifying news headlines/articles.
- The user can input any custom news and receive instant prediction feedback (REAL or FAKE).

---

## Goals

- Build a text classification model using machine learning techniques.
- Use natural language processing (NLP) to convert text into machine-readable format (TF-IDF).
- Train and evaluate a model to distinguish fake and real news.
- Provide a user-friendly terminal interface for real-time predictions.

## Key Features

- **Terminal Interface**: Users can type/paste custom news text directly into the console.
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: Transforms raw news text into numerical features.
- **Passive Aggressive Classifier**: Efficient and fast model for binary classification.
- **Balanced Dataset Handling**: Ensures fair model training by using equal fake and real samples.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Instantly predicts whether the entered news is REAL or FAKE.
- **Accuracy Report**: Displays overall model performance after training.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ for model building & evaluation
- **Pandas** â€“ for data handling
- **TfidfVectorizer** â€“ for NLP-based feature extraction
- **PassiveAggressiveClassifier** â€“ for classification

---

## How It Works (Flow)

- Dataset (`True.csv` and `Fake.csv`) is loaded from Kaggle.
- Data is merged, shuffled, and split into training and testing sets.
- Text is converted to TF-IDF features.
- Model is trained using the PassiveAggressiveClassifier.
- User is prompted to enter custom news text.
- The model predicts and returns the label: `REAL` ðŸ“° or `FAKE` ðŸš¨.
